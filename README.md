MyEd 2.oh-dear
==============

A proof of concept design on how some MyEd functionality could be implemented
in an alternative way using a variety of University and City data sets.


Features
--------

The `MyEd2.oh-dear` web app is designed to be one of the most powerful
services ever written - not only will it have channels for the mundane
checking email and seeing your timetable, it will also boast live streams of
*Pimp My Ride* in the *Thug Lyf* channel, and a special script coded
in Unicorn Speak that will simultaneously fix the lifts in Appleton Tower and
remove all asbestos, turning the concrete monolith of death into a building
that's actually safe to work in.

Please note: Not all features will make it into the final release.
